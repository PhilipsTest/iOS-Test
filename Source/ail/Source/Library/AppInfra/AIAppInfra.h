/**
 To enable an application developer to create his own implementation for specific App Infra modules and have all components integrated in the app use that alternative module implementation; App Infra supports a builder pattern. By the use of the builder pattern, it is possible to create an instance of App Infra with alternative module implementations that overwrite one or more of the default module implementations.
 The most common use case for providing alternative implementations is for testing purposes where a (component test-) app wants to test its functionality in isolation without having to implicitly test the App Infra implementation or any cloud services abstracted by App Infra. In such a case, the app developer can create an App Infra instance with dummy implementations.
 Another use case for implementation replacement is to provide the ability to maintain compatibility with another cloud back-end (version).
